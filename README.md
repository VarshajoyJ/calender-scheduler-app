It lets you plan project milestones and ensure you deliver things on time. But a planning management calendar is just one of the four calendars involved in project management. Project calendar helps you keep track of impending meetings, deadlines, and milestones. They can aid in the visualization of your calendar and serve as a reminder of crucial occasions such as holidays and vacation time. The issue is that individuals frequently handle many calendars at the same time. When these calendars are not connected with your job and synchronized with one another, it can cause tremendous confusion, headaches, and missed deadlines. If you already maintain and update one or more calendars, you might not think calendar functionality is a vital component of Project Management Software.

Traditional calendars, for example, are fantastic for arranging your day but poor for planning, visualizing and discussing project work. While your online calendar may remind you of an imminent deadline, it is not meant to inform you what tasks are necessary to reach the deadline, who is working on them, and where they are in the completion process.
